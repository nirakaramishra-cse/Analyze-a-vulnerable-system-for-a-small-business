# Vulnerability Assessment — Public Database Server

**Date:** 1 January 20XX  
**Assessment period:** June 20XX – August 20XX  
**Framework used:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1

---

## System Description

The asset under assessment is a remotely accessible MySQL database server
running on a Linux system with 128GB RAM. The server communicates over IPv4,
supports remote employee queries, and uses TLS for encryption. Public access
increases the attack surface and exposes the server to unauthorized attempts at
data theft, tampering, or disruption.

---

## Scope

This assessment focuses only on **logical access controls, authentication,
authorization, and network exposure** of the database server. It excludes
physical security and cloud infrastructure controls.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the security risks associated with
the database server being publicly accessible. The server stores customer and
business data essential for analytics and marketing operations, making
confidentiality and integrity critical. A compromise or outage would disrupt
operations, reduce customer trust, and cause financial impact. This assessment
identifies threat sources, threat events, and recommended controls aligned with
business objectives.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source                | Threat Event                                         | Likelihood (1–3) | Severity (1–3) | Risk |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------:|---------------:|-----:|
| External hacker             | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration         | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Malicious/careless employee | Disrupt mission-critical operations                   | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Competitor                  | Alter or delete critical business data                | 2 | 3 | 6 |

---

## Approach

This assessment follows the qualitative risk rating guidance from NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1. Threat sources were selected based on the system’s exposure,
remote employee model, and competitive environment. Likelihood was estimated
based on ease of access and typical attacker capability, while severity scores
reflect business impact on operations, customer trust, and data integrity.
Risks were prioritized to guide remediation aligned with business goals.

## Remediation Strategy

To mitigate identified risks, remove public database exposure by placing the
server in a private network and enforcing IP allow-listing. Implement
multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls to reduce the risk of
unauthorized access. Enable TLS for secure communication and enforce encryption
at rest. Deploy monitoring, logging, intrusion detection, and verified backups.
Apply least-privilege principles, regular access reviews, and incident response
readiness to improve overall security posture.
